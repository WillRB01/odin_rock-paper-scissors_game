# rock-paper-scissors_game

This project is my first ever Javascript project. 

The point of the project is to get hands on practice with making a JS project from scratch and using everything I know about JS 
(and then some) to make a functioning rock, paper, scissors game where the player first to 5 points, wins.

This project REALLY stress-tested my current JS knowledge and understanding but I'm really glad I started and finished it.

Skills I got to practice with this project:

Problem solving, JS understanding and utilization, writing pseudocode, being able to start and finish a project,
practical JS application, and writing better commit messages.

Now, the game isn't done per say, there's no GUI or ability to play with another person, etc. but the actual play a game logic 
against a computer is done and those are the only requirements I need to meet at the moment.

I will be coming back to this project in the near future.

I can now confidently say I know a little bit of JS's basics. 

There's still a long road ahead to say I'm 100% confident in my abilities with JS but I'm loving the process.

Slow and steady wins the race!
